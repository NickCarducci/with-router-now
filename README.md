## Idea behind the example

Take a look at `now.json`. We are uploading the result of the razzle build, and setting up the routes for the app entry point and all static resources.

We are also setting the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. Most likely, your app will use other environment variables, beware you should not commit secrets like api keys and others into your repository. Take a look at now's documentation to understand what you should do in such cases.

## Documentation

  Then I replaced server.js, app.test.js, client.js and package.json at least with-react-router example. This seems to work, but I am using this to test from instead of recreating it during development integrating my client code
  
  It's blank because I erased the react-router Route in Switch to Home and About, idk why I did but I did and that is why it is blank white screen when it works
